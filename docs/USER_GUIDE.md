# OrchestraACME — User Guide

Run the lab from the **Attack Panel**, generate telemetry, hunt in Splunk, and **light up** the GenAI Compliance Monitor app.

**Attack Panel:** http://localhost:5001  
**Banking app:** http://localhost:5000  
**Splunk:** http://localhost:8000 (local Docker profile)

> **Terminology:** The Attack Panel and workshop use **Scenario 1–10** (one per agentic threat surface). In Splunk telemetry the scenario index is stored in the numeric field `campaign_week` (values 1–10) — use that field in SPL, not the phrase “campaign week” in reports or training materials.

**New here?** Complete [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), then follow the ordered curriculum in **[WORKSHOP.md](WORKSHOP.md)** and run **Level 1 — First Win**.

---

## Prerequisites

> **Complete checklist:** **[PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md)** — hardware, Docker install (Ubuntu/macOS/Windows), `docker.sock` permissions, Splunk one-time setup, verification.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/machowdhury/OrchestraACME.git
cd OrchestraACME
cp .env.example .env
docker compose --profile local up --build -d
```

> **Cloud VM (AWS EC2 / Azure / Google Compute Engine):** See [docs/CLOUD_VM_DEPLOYMENT.md](CLOUD_VM_DEPLOYMENT.md) for which ports to open on security groups / firewalls (`5000`, `5001`, `8000` restricted — never expose `8088`, `11434`, or OTel ports to the internet).

Wait for Ollama (`docker compose logs -f ollama`). Configure Splunk HEC and install the compliance app — [splunk_app/INSTALL.md](../splunk_app/INSTALL.md).

Confirm the panel header shows **TARGET ONLINE** and **LLM ONLINE** before firing attacks.

**Splunk quick checklist** (do once after `docker compose up`):

1. `./scripts/splunk_local_bootstrap.sh` — enables HEC, creates index `acme_agentic_telemetry`, creates token matching `.env`
2. `./scripts/package_splunk_app.sh` → install `dist/acme_genai_compliance-*.tar.gz` (version in filename)
3. Verify: `` index=acme_agentic_telemetry earliest=-15m | stats count ``

---

## The Workshop

> **Full curriculum + verbose overview:** **[WORKSHOP.md](WORKSHOP.md)** — why teams run it, deliverables, daily-work skills by role, Levels 0–5, hunt questions Q101–Q503.

The OrchestraACME Workshop is a **hands-on lab**, not theory-only training: learners attack a live multi-agent banking app, observe runtime controls (block / allow / detect-only), and **prove outcomes in Splunk**. Skills transfer directly to SOC triage, detection engineering, architecture reviews, and GRC evidence — see [About the OrchestraACME Workshop](WORKSHOP.md#about-the-orchestraacme-workshop) for full detail.

The Attack Panel **// Workshop** tab runs guided attack paths. **Splunk Search** is where learners answer hunt questions — same pattern as [Splunk BOTS](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3). See [Splunk vs Jupyter](WORKSHOP.md#splunk-vs-jupyter--recommendation).

### Quick map

| Level | Audience | Attack Panel | Splunk |

## Beyond the Workshop — expand your knowledge

The Workshop is the **on-ramp**. The other Attack Panel tabs and Splunk dashboards are how you go deeper. Use this map to decide what to explore next and **why** each capability exists.

### Learning progression

```text
Workshop (guided paths)
    ↓
Top 10 Scenarios (one surface at a time, Full Pipeline variant)
    ↓
Threat Chains (multi-stage stories, incident_id correlation)
    ↓
All 45 Techniques (MITRE breadth, LIVE / SIMULATED / HYBRID modes)
    ↓
Custom Payload (your own strings, agent targeting)
    ↓
Splunk Threat Hunting + SPL macros (practitioner hunts)
```

### Additional capabilities — what, why, when

| Capability | Where | What it adds beyond Workshop | Why we built it |
|------------|-------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Individual scenarios** | Top 10 tab | Pause on one surface; use **Preview Payload** | Deep-dive a single OWASP / NIST mapping in class |
| **Full Pipeline** | Top 10 → ⚡ on any card | Same attack through **all 4 agents** | Shows how one payload propagates across an agent chain |
| **Threat Chains (KC-*)** | Threat Chains tab | 5-stage rogue-actor narratives | Teaches kill-chain thinking and `incident_id` hunts |
| **45-technique registry** | All 45 tab | Full MITRE ATLAS library; per-technique **EXECUTE** | Proves detection **coverage %**, not just 10 demos |
| **LIVE vs SIMULATED vs HYBRID** | Technique cards | Some threats cannot be ethically live-fired | Supply-chain / recon style events still appear in Splunk for hunts |
| **Custom Payload** | Custom tab | Your own injection strings | Red-team exercises and variant testing |
| **Control Attestation dashboard** | Splunk app | NIST pass/fail per scenario | Bridges security engineering and governance audiences |
| **Detection Efficacy dashboard** | Splunk app | Coverage %, MTTD, chain completeness | Answers “are we measuring agentic risk?” with numbers |
| **Technique Coverage Matrix** | Splunk app | OBSERVED vs NOT_OBSERVED grid | Prioritize purple-team backlog from evidence |
| **Actor Chain Story** | Splunk app | Timeline per `incident_id` | SOC-style narrative for leadership |
| **Threat Hunting playbooks** | Splunk app | Starter SPL per technique | Graduates learners from buttons to queries |

### Suggested expansion paths by goal

| Your goal | After Workshop, do this |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Teach **one** surface deeply (e.g. MCP tools) | Top 10 → Scenario 6 only → run hunt SPL → discuss BLOCKED vs INJECTED |
| Teach **pipeline** risk | Same scenario with **⚡ Full Pipeline** → compare single-agent vs 4-agent events |
| Teach **SOC correlation** | Threat Chains → KC-A001 and KC-D001 → Actor Chain Story + correlation SPL |
| Build a **coverage report** | All 45 → RUN ALL 45 → Technique Coverage Matrix screenshot + NOT_OBSERVED list |
| Teach **governance** | Fire All 10 → Control Attestation + NIST AI RMF Scoring walkthrough |
| Run a **mini red team** | Custom tab + mix of chains; learners write hunts in Splunk |

---

## What we built the Workshop with (lab stack)

The Workshop is not a separate product — it orchestrates components already in OrchestraACME. Understanding the stack helps you explain the lab credibly and troubleshoot when something does not light up.

### End-to-end flow

```text
Workshop button (Attack Panel :5001)
    → REST API (/api/exploit, /api/chains, /api/techniques/execute-all)
    → Banking app (:5000) — 4 agents, workflow guards, CodeGuard, DefenseClaw
    → Ollama (:11434) — live LLM inference (llama3.2:1b by default)
    → OpenTelemetry spans + security attributes
    → OTel Collector (:4318) — batch, enrich
    → Splunk HEC (:8088) — index acme_agentic_telemetry
    → GenAI Compliance Monitor app — dashboards, macros, hunts
```

### Components called by Workshop paths

| Component | Role in Workshop | Path / artifact |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Attack Panel** (`apps/exploit_ui.py`) | UI, Workshop sequencer, terminal feed | http://localhost:5001 |
| **Workshop definitions** | Step lists, delays, Splunk checklist (client-side `WORKSHOPS` object) | Attack Panel `// Workshop` tab |
| **Banking app** (`apps/app_runtime.py`, `agents/agent_router.py`) | Agent APIs, pipeline, OTel export | http://localhost:5000 |
| **Attack payloads** (`apps/framework/attack_payloads.py`) | Scenarios 1–10 adversarial strings + metadata | Used by `/api/exploit/<n>` |
| **Workflow guard** (`apps/framework/workflow_guard.py`) | Pre-LLM policy — orchestration, MCP, A2A, memory | Scenarios 2, 6, 8, 10 |
| **MCP gateway** (`apps/framework/mcp_gateway.py`) | Tool scope enforcement | Scenario 6, KC-C001 stages |
| **A2A verifier** (`apps/framework/a2a_verifier.py`) | Delegation / DID checks | Scenario 8, KC-D001 |
| **Memory policy** (`apps/framework/memory_policy.py`) | Persistent instruction abuse | Scenario 10 |
| **RAG store / probe** (`apps/framework/rag_store.py`) | Retrieval anomaly telemetry | Scenario 9, KC-A001 |
| **Orchestration guard** (`apps/framework/orchestration_guard.py`) | Supervisor bypass detection | Scenario 2 |
| **CodeGuard** (in `llm_client.py`) | Input pattern block | Scenario 3 |
| **DefenseClaw** (in `llm_client.py`) | Output HARD_DENY | Scenario 5 |
| **Control validator** (`control_validator.py` + `control_matrix.yaml`) | NIST pass/fail on emit | Control Attestation dashboard |
| **Technique executor** (`apps/framework/technique_executor.py`) | 45 MITRE playbooks (LIVE/SIM/HYBRID) | Deep Workshop, All 45 tab |
| **Kill chain engine** (`apps/framework/chain_engine.py`) | KC-A001…E001 staged execution + `incident_id` | Standard Workshop |
| **Ollama** | Local LLM — non-deterministic BLOCKED vs INJECTED | Docker service `ollama` |
| **OTel Collector** | OTLP → Splunk HEC + optional JSONL | `otel_collector` in compose |
| **Splunk compliance app** | Dashboards, lookups, macros `` `acme_campaign_w1` `` … | `splunk_app/splunk_compliance_app/` |

### Splunk artifacts the Workshop expects

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Index `acme_agentic_telemetry` | Stores all workshop-generated events |
| Sourcetype `otel:agentic:json` | HEC routing |
| Macro `` `acme_genai_index` `` | Base search for all dashboards |
| Macros `` `acme_campaign_w1` `` … `` `w10` `` | Per-scenario hunts (match Scenario 1–10) |
| Lookups `acme_framework_lookup`, `acme_control_matrix_lookup` | Technique matrix + NIST attestation |
| Dashboards Overview, Detection Efficacy, Control Attestation, Technique Coverage Matrix, Actor Chain Story | Workshop completion checklists |

### What is real vs simulated (teach this honestly)

| Real | Simulated / enriched (still valid for hunts) |
|------|---------------------------------------------|
| HTTP attack traffic, Ollama inference | Some 45-technique **SIMULATED** events (supply chain, recon) |
| CodeGuard / DefenseClaw / workflow guard decisions | SOAR containment fields (lab stub, not a live SOAR) |
| OTel → Splunk pipeline (when HEC configured) | “Cisco” product names on fields — lab middleware, not commercial products |
| Kill chain **HYBRID** stages where live LLM applies | Accelerated chain timing (`accelerated: true`) |

Saying this out loud in a workshop builds trust and mirrors how production ranges mix live execution with safe simulation.

---

## Attack Panel — all options

Everything at **http://localhost:5001**. Five tabs on the left; **Real-Time Attack Feed** on the right.

```
Click (Workshop / Scenario / Chain) → Banking app → Ollama → OTel → Splunk → Dashboard
```

### Tab 0 — `// Workshop` (guided learning paths)

Progress and a Splunk checklist appear in the panel after each path completes.

---

### Tab 1 — `// Top 10 Scenarios`

| Button | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| **▶ FIRE SCENARIO n → … AGENT** | One adversarial payload to one agent (fastest demo). |
| **⚡ Full Pipeline** | Same payload through all **4 agents** in sequence. |
| **👁 Preview Payload** | Raw attack string (does not fire). |

Cards are labeled **SCENARIO n — SURFACE** (e.g. Scenario 6 — TOOLS SURFACE). See [THREAT_SURFACES.md](THREAT_SURFACES.md) for the conceptual map.

---

### Tab 2 — `// All 45 Techniques`

| Button | What it does |
|--------|----------------|
| **↻ Reload Catalog** | Refresh 45 technique cards. |
| **⚡ RUN ALL 45 TECHNIQUES** | Full registry (LIVE + SIMULATED + HYBRID). ~10–20 min. |
| **▶ EXECUTE** (per card) | One technique (e.g. `AML.T0050`). |

| Mode | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **LIVE** | Real Ollama call |
| **SIMULATED** | Enriched OTel only |
| **HYBRID** | Both |

---

### Tab 3 — `// Threat Chains`

| Button | What it does |
|--------|----------------|

## Light up the Splunk Compliance App

**“Lit up”** = events in `index=acme_agentic_telemetry`, macros resolve, dashboards show **non-zero** panels.

### What to click → dashboard → why

After each action: wait **30–60 seconds**.

| Your goal | What to click | Dashboard | Why it populates |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------------|
| Prove telemetry | Workshop **First Win** or any **▶ FIRE SCENARIO n** | **Overview** | `gen_ai.agent.*` on `otel:agentic:json` events |
| Input/output blocking | **Scenario 3** or **5** | **Control Attestation** | `codeguard_blocked`, `defenseclaw.action`, `control.status` |
| Workflow-surface blocks | **Scenario 2**, **6**, or **8** | **Detection Efficacy** | `workflow.block_reason` (orchestration, MCP, A2A) |
| All 10 surfaces | **FIRE ALL 10 SCENARIOS** (Workshop) | **Control Attestation** | Scenarios 1–10 + NIST fields |
| Technique breadth | **RUN ALL 45** or Deep Workshop | **Technique Coverage Matrix** | `technique_id` → OBSERVED / NOT_OBSERVED |
| Multi-stage story | **KC-C001** or Standard Workshop | **Actor Chain Story** | Shared `incident_id` across stages |
| Detect-only RAG | **Scenario 9** | Threat Hunting / Overview | `galileo_observe_alert` without always blocking |
| Token / cost abuse | **Scenario 7** or **KC-E001** | **Detection Efficacy** | `gen_ai.usage.*_tokens`, `call_depth_detected` |

### Minimum viable check (2 minutes)

1. Workshop → **▶ RUN FIRST WIN PATH** (or **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 6**)
2. Splunk:

```spl
`acme_campaign_w6` earliest=-15m
| table _time tool.scope_violation workflow.block_reason control.status
```

3. **Control Attestation** — scenario 6 row has data  
4. **Overview** — event count > 0  

### Macro tweak

If Search has data but dashboards are empty, edit macro **`acme_genai_index`** to match your index name.

---

## GenAI Compliance Monitor — dashboard & visualization guide

**App name in Splunk:** GenAI Compliance Monitor (`acme_genai_compliance` v2.3+)  
**Install:** `./scripts/package_splunk_app.sh` → `dist/acme_genai_compliance-2.3.0.tar.gz`  
**Validate (Cloud/Enterprise):** `./scripts/validate_splunk_app.sh` — see [splunk_app/CLOUD_VETTING.md](../splunk_app/CLOUD_VETTING.md)

All dashboards read `` `acme_genai_index` `` (default: `index=acme_agentic_telemetry sourcetype="otel:agentic:json"`). Empty panels mean no telemetry yet — run a Workshop path first.

**Note:** Scheduled detection saved searches ship **disabled** for Splunk Cloud-safe install. Enable them under **Settings → Searches, reports, and alerts** after HEC ingest is verified (see **Setup Guide** dashboard).

## Top 10 scenarios — surface, hunt, learning question

For each: **Top 10 Scenarios** tab → **▶ FIRE SCENARIO n** → wait 60s → SPL → dashboard.

| Scenario | Surface | Click | Typical status | Key fields | Learning question | Dashboard |
|----------|---------|-------|----------------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Supply chain / drift | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 1** | Drift telemetry | `cisco_aibom_status`, `cisco.aibom.*`, `agent.aibom_validated` | *How would you detect prompt drift without blocking every request?* | Control Attestation, **MLTK Anomaly Hunting** |
| 2 | Orchestration | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 2** | BLOCKED | `foundry.orchestrator_override`, `workflow.block_reason` | *Why enforce policy at the orchestrator, not only in prompts?* | Detection Efficacy |
| 3 | Input validation | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 3** | BLOCKED | `codeguard.rule_id`, `codeguard_blocked` | *What attacks does input validation miss if you skip output inspection?* | Control Attestation |
| 4 | Shadow runtime | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 4** | INJECTED + discovery | `slm.unapproved`, `deployment.tier` | *How do you govern models IT never approved?* | Overview |
| 5 | Output gateway | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 5** | BLOCKED or INJECTED | `defenseclaw.action`, `defenseclaw_blocked` | *When is post-LLM output inspection the right layer?* | Control Attestation |
| 6 | Tools (MCP) | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 6** | BLOCKED | `tool.scope_violation`, `mcp.gateway.rule_id` | *Why block tool abuse before the LLM runs?* | Detection Efficacy |
| 7 | Cost / DoS | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 7** | Often INJECTED + **CTSM anomaly** | `gen_ai.usage.*_tokens`, `cisco_tsm_anomaly_score`, `mltk.ctsm_signal` | *What is your token budget alert threshold per agent?* | **MLTK Anomaly Hunting** |
| 8 | Agent identity (A2A) | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 8** | BLOCKED | `cryptographic_passport_valid=false` | *Who is allowed to delegate authority between agents?* | Control Attestation |
| 9 | Retrieval (RAG) | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 9** | Alert, not always block | `galileo_observe_alert`, `galileo_anomaly_score` | *Why might detect-only be correct for retrieval exfil?* | Threat Hunting, **MLTK Anomaly Hunting** |
| 10 | Memory / SOC | **▶ FIRE SCENARIO 10** | BLOCKED + SOAR | `containment.action`, `soar.playbook_id` | *How fast must containment run once memory policy fires?* | Control Attestation |

### Example hunt — Scenario 6

```spl
`acme_campaign_w6` earliest=-15m
| table _time session.id tool.scope_violation mcp.gateway.rule_id workflow.block_reason control.status control.pass_rate_pct
```

### All 10 scenarios

Workshop → **▶ FIRE ALL 10 SCENARIOS**, then:

```spl
`acme_genai_index` earliest=-1h campaign_week=*
| stats count by campaign_week workflow.block_reason defenseclaw.action
| sort campaign_week
```

---

## Kill chains

**Tab 3** → **▶ EXECUTE THREAT CHAIN**, or use **Standard Workshop**.

| Chain | Best dashboard | Learning question |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| KC-A001 | Actor Chain Story | *How would you spot slow RAG exfil without a single HARD_DENY?* |
| KC-B001 | Control Attestation | *What supply-chain signal precedes model backdoor behavior?* |
| KC-C001 | Actor Chain Story | *Which stage would you block first in a fraud pipeline?* |
| KC-D001 | Control Attestation | *How do you bind agent identity cryptographically in production?* |
| KC-E001 | Detection Efficacy | *What cost anomaly would trigger finance + security jointly?* |

**Correlation hunt:**

```spl
`acme_genai_index` incident_id=ACME-INC-* earliest=-1h
| stats values(technique_id) as techniques values(framework.kill_chain_stage) as stages count as events by incident_id
| eval stage_count=mvcount(stages)
| where stage_count>=2
| sort - stage_count
```

---

## 45 techniques

**Tab 2** → **⚡ RUN ALL 45** or **Deep Workshop**.

```spl
| inputlookup acme_framework_lookup
| join type=left technique_id [
    search `acme_genai_index` earliest=-24h
    | stats count as events by technique_id
  ]
| eval status=if(isnull(events),"NOT_OBSERVED","OBSERVED")
| table technique_id technique_name tactic_name status events severity
```

Aim for **coverage % > 50%** on **Technique Coverage Matrix** after a full run.

## Layered defenses

| Layer | When | Terminal signal |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| Workflow guard | Before LLM | `workflow.block_reason` |
| CodeGuard | Before LLM | `codeguard_blocked=true` |
| DefenseClaw | After LLM | `defenseclaw.action=HARD_DENY` |

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **BLOCKED** | Guard fired — still valuable Splunk evidence |
| **INJECTED** | Model reached — detection-gap exercise |

---

## Banking app (benign baseline)

http://localhost:5000 — normal loan processing UI.

**Continuous baseline (default):** With `TRAFFIC_SIM_ENABLED=true` (see `.env`), the banking app sends **benign loan requests** every 90–240 seconds through live Ollama agents. Events land in Splunk with `testbed_mode=BASELINE_TRAFFIC` so hunts can separate noise from attacks.

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `GET /api/v1/traffic/status` | Simulator running, tick counts, last error |
| `POST /api/v1/traffic/start` | Start background loop |
| `POST /api/v1/traffic/stop` | Pause baseline (attacks still work) |
| `POST /api/v1/traffic/tick` | Fire one baseline event immediately |

**Splunk — baseline only:**

```spl
`acme_genai_index` earliest=-1h testbed_mode=BASELINE_TRAFFIC
| timechart span=5m count by gen_ai.agent.name
```

**Splunk — attacks only (exclude baseline):**

```spl
`acme_genai_index` earliest=-1h NOT testbed_mode=BASELINE_TRAFFIC
```

~20% of baseline ticks run the **full 4-agent pipeline**; the rest hit **intake only** to keep CPU load reasonable on small VMs. Tune with `TRAFFIC_SIM_PIPELINE_RATIO`, `TRAFFIC_SIM_INTERVAL_MIN_SEC`, `TRAFFIC_SIM_INTERVAL_MAX_SEC` in `.env`.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **TARGET OFFLINE** | `docker compose ps` — banking_app healthy |
| **LLM OFFLINE** | Wait for Ollama; check `/api/v1/ollama/health` |
| Workshop stuck | Keep tab open; Deep Workshop includes 10–20 min RUN ALL 45 |
| Tab 2 / 3 empty | **↻ Reload Catalog** or refresh |
| Dashboards empty, Search has data | Fix `acme_genai_index` macro |
| Scenarios 2, 6, 8 always BLOCKED | Expected — pre-LLM guards |
| Scenario 9 not blocked | Expected — detect-only |
