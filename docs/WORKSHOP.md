## About the OrchestraACME Workshop

### What it is

The **OrchestraACME Workshop** is a hands-on security lab curriculum — live exercises in a running environment, not lecture-only training. Learners operate a realistic **multi-agent loan-processing application** under attack, observe how **runtime controls** behave (block, allow, detect-only), and prove outcomes in **Splunk** using the same workflows they use in production SOC and detection engineering.

Two tools work together:

| Tool | Role in the workshop |
|------|----------------------|
| **Attack Panel** (`:5001`) | Fires ordered, reproducible adversarial scenarios and kill chains — one click runs a full learning path |
| **Splunk** (`:8000`) | Answers hunt questions, validates blocks and alerts, produces coverage and compliance evidence |

Every attack sends **real HTTP traffic** through **live Ollama inference**. Telemetry uses **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** (`gen_ai.*`, `workflow.*`, `framework.*`) and lands in Splunk as `otel:agentic:json`. Outcomes are genuinely non-deterministic: some runs **BLOCK**, others **INJECT** — which is intentional. Production agent security is not binary.

The curriculum is **ordered** (Levels 0–5), **role-aware** (analyst through GRC), and includes **BOTS-style hunt questions** (Q101–Q503) — the same pedagogy as [Splunk BOTS](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3), applied to agentic AI telemetry.

---

### Why organizations run this workshop

Most agentic-AI security training fails in predictable ways:

| Failure mode | What goes wrong | How this workshop fixes it |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Theory without telemetry** | Teams discuss MCP and RAG risks but never see `workflow.block_reason` in a SIEM | Every path emits searchable OTel fields you can hunt the same day |
| **Prompt demos without surfaces** | Red teams test injection strings on a chatbot, not tool gateways or A2A trust chains | Ten scenarios map to **workflow surfaces** — tools, RAG, memory, A2A, orchestration, supply chain |
| **Controls without evidence** | “We use guardrails” with no pass/fail per control or scenario | **Control Attestation** and NIST panels show PASS/FAIL per scenario (1–10) |
| **Detection without coverage math** | Ad hoc Splunk searches with no sense of MITRE breadth | **Technique Coverage Matrix** shows OBSERVED vs NOT_OBSERVED across 45 techniques |
| **Architecture without validation** | Threat models sit in documents; nobody checks if telemetry would catch predicted failures | Optional **MAESTRO** path: model → attack → prove layer coverage in Splunk |
| **Splunk training on synthetic logs** | Analysts learn SPL on stale canned data unrelated to GenAI | Hunts use **your lab’s live index** after **your** attacks — field names match emerging GenAI conventions |

**Who typically sponsors a workshop:**

- **Security leadership** — demonstrate measurable agentic risk program, not AI buzzwords
- **SOC / detection teams** — build hunts before production agents ship
- **Platform / AppSec** — validate where to place controls (pre-LLM vs post-LLM vs detect-only)
- **GRC / risk** — produce framework-aligned evidence (OWASP LLM, NIST AI RMF, MAESTRO layers)
- **Splunk practitioners** — practice GenAI telemetry, MLTK anomaly patterns, and compliance dashboards on realistic data

---

### What participants walk away with

Concrete **deliverables**, not just awareness:

| Deliverable | Where it lives after the workshop |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Working hunt SPL** | Q201–Q503 queries in this doc; macros `` `acme_campaign_w6` `` … `` `w10` ``; Threat Hunting playbooks |
| **Dashboard literacy** | Twelve Splunk views — Overview, Detection Efficacy, Control Attestation, Technique Coverage, Actor Chain Story, NIST AI RMF, etc. |
| **Reproducible attack scenarios** | Top 10 scenarios + 5 kill chains + 45-technique registry — re-run anytime for regression or demos |
| **Control placement vocabulary** | Pre-LLM workflow block vs post-LLM output deny vs detect-only — defensible in architecture reviews |
| **Coverage baseline** | Screenshot or export of technique OBSERVED % and NOT_OBSERVED backlog |
| **Compliance narrative** | NIST control pass/fail per scenario; MAESTRO layer coverage % |
| **Honest gap analysis** | Terminal `INJECTED` outcomes — where models complied despite controls; fuels detection backlog |
| **Optional Cisco / MLTK path** | AIBOM + MCP scan telemetry, CTSM token anomaly patterns (when overlay enabled) |

Participants leave with artifacts they can **paste into Confluence**, **attach to audit responses**, or **adapt into production detection rules** — because field names and patterns mirror what enterprises are standardizing on for GenAI observability.

### Skills you will use in daily work

Skills are mapped by role. You do not need every level; follow the [role quick-start](#role-quick-start-pick-one-row) row that matches your job.

#### Junior SOC analyst

**Daily work context:** Triage alerts, initial investigation, escalate with context.

| Skill | Workshop level | On-the-job use |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Confirm GenAI telemetry ingest | Level 0–1 | “Are we actually logging agent calls?” — first question on any AI incident |
| Hunt by scenario number | Level 1–2 | Map alerts to **which agent surface** failed (tools vs output vs retrieval) |
| Read `workflow.blocked` and `workflow.block_reason` | Level 1, Q204 | Triage pre-LLM blocks vs model-reached events |
| Read `defenseclaw.action` / `codeguard_blocked` | Level 1, Q102 | Distinguish output-side denials from input validation |
| Field discovery on unfamiliar sourcetypes | Level 2, Q201–Q203 | Same muscle memory as BOTS — explore before you filter |
| Use macros and time bounds | All levels | Production hunts: `` `acme_genai_index` `` pattern translates to your org’s index macro |

**Outcome:** You can open a GenAI security event, name the **control layer** that fired, and write a basic SPL triage query without waiting for a senior analyst.

---

#### Senior SOC analyst / incident responder

---

#### Workshop facilitator

**Daily work context:** Run brown-bags, customer workshops, internal enablement.

| Skill | Resource | On-the-job use |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| 90-minute scripted session | [Facilitator runbook](#facilitator-runbook-90-minute-session) | Repeatable delivery without rewriting content |
| Role-based pacing | [Role quick-start](#role-quick-start-pick-one-row) | Right depth for mixed audiences |
| BOTS-style progressive hunts | Q201–Q210 | Keeps room engaged in Splunk Search |
| Benign + malicious traffic contrast | Level 0 tip | Overview dashboard shows normal vs attack traffic |

---

### What makes this different from “AI security awareness” training

| Typical awareness session | OrchestraACME Workshop |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Theory-only prompt injection training | Live injection against Ollama with logged outcome |
| Generic “monitor your LLM” | Specific fields: `workflow.block_reason`, `technique_id`, `framework.maestro_layers` |
| One demo video | 45 techniques + 5 kill chains you re-run locally |
| Quiz on OWASP LLM Top 10 | Splunk panel showing which categories **fired** in your environment |
| Architecture diagram only | Optional MAESTRO + Splunk **prove** loop |

---

### Time investment

| Depth | Levels | Typical time | Best for |
|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Taster** | 0 + 1 | ~35 min | Executives, kickoff, “is the lab alive?” |
| **SOC foundation** | 0–2 | ~2 hours | Junior–mid analysts |
| **SOC advanced** | 0–3 | ~3 hours | Senior analysts, IR |
| **Detection engineering** | 0–4 | ~4 hours | Detection engineers, purple team |
| **Full program** | 0–5 | ~6–8 hours | Architects, GRC, multi-day enablement |

---

## How to use this guide

Read top to bottom **once**, then jump to your role track. Every level assumes the previous level is complete.

```text
Level 0  Environment          (everyone, ~20 min)
Level 1  Pipeline proof        (everyone, ~15 min)
Level 2  SOC hunts            (analysts, ~45 min)     ← BOTS-style questions in Splunk Search
Level 3  Correlation          (senior analyst, ~30 min)
Level 4  Detection engineering (detection engineer, ~60 min)
Level 5  Architecture & GRC    (architect + compliance, ~90 min)
```

**Where to run queries:** Always in **Splunk Search** (or copy from **Threat Hunting** / **MLTK Anomaly Hunting** dashboards). Do not skip Splunk — the workshop is designed to build SIEM muscle memory.

**Where to fire attacks:** Attack Panel → **// Workshop** (or individual scenario buttons).

**Timing rule:** Wait **60 seconds** after each Attack Panel path before running SPL.

> **Public terminology:** Use **Scenario 1–10** in workshops and customer-facing materials. Splunk events store the scenario index in field `campaign_week` (integer 1–10). SPL examples below use that field name; do not label it “campaign week” in narratives.

---

## Level 0 — Environment (everyone)

**Time:** about 20–45 minutes the first time (longer while Ollama downloads the AI model).  
**Goal:** Make sure all three parts of the lab can talk to each other — the **banking app**, the **attack panel**, and **Splunk** — before you run any workshop scenarios.

You do **not** need to understand Docker, Splunk, or AI to complete Level 0. Follow each step in order. If a step says **PASS**, you are done with that step. If something does not match **PASS**, use the troubleshooting table at the end of this section or ask your facilitator.

### What you are setting up (plain language)

Think of the lab as three websites that work together:

| Piece | What it is | Address (on your laptop) |
|-------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Banking app** | A fake bank loan system with four AI assistants | http://localhost:5000 |
| **Attack Panel** | The workshop remote control — runs practice attacks | http://localhost:5001 |
| **Splunk** | Where security logs appear as charts and tables | http://localhost:8000 |

Behind the scenes, Docker runs several small programs (containers) on your machine. You only need to open those three URLs in your browser for Level 0.

> **Using a cloud server instead of your laptop?**  
> Replace `localhost` with your server’s address (for example `http://203.0.113.50:5001`). Firewall steps: [CLOUD_VM_DEPLOYMENT.md](CLOUD_VM_DEPLOYMENT.md).

> **Using Splunk Cloud instead of local Splunk?**  
> You still complete Level 0 for the banking app and Attack Panel. Splunk steps use **your Splunk Cloud URL** in the browser — see [Path B](#path-b--splunk-cloud-or-company-splunk-no-local-splunk-container) below.

---

### Before you start — checklist

> **Full install guide:** [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md) — Docker on Ubuntu, `docker.sock` permissions, Splunk app, verification.

Ask your facilitator or IT contact if you are unsure. You need:

- [ ] A computer or VM with **Docker Engine 24+** and **Compose v2** — `docker compose version` works  
- [ ] **`docker ps` works without `sudo`** (Linux) — if not, see [PREREQUISITES § docker.sock](PREREQUISITES.md#fix-permission-denied-on-dockersock)  
- [ ] At least **16 GB RAM** recommended if Splunk runs on the same machine  
- [ ] Internet access for the first startup (downloads the AI model, ~1.3 GB)  
- [ ] A web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)  
- [ ] The OrchestraACME project folder (from `git clone` or a zip from your instructor)  
- [ ] About **30–60 minutes** on first boot — Splunk and the AI model take time to start  

**You do not need:** a Splunk license separately (local lab includes one in Docker), or your own OpenAI API key.

---

### Choose your setup path

| Path | Splunk runs… | Start command |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **A — Local lab (most classrooms)** | In Docker on your machine | `docker compose --profile local up --build -d` |
| **B — Splunk Cloud / company Splunk** | On Splunk Cloud or another server | `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.external.yml up --build -d` |

Path **A** is the default in this guide. Path **B** skips the local Splunk container; your admin configures HEC — see [splunk_app/INSTALL.md](../splunk_app/INSTALL.md) Section 2.

---

### Step 0.1 — Start the lab software

**Who does this:** Usually one person per machine (facilitator or tech lead). Learners can watch or follow along.

1. Open a **terminal** (Mac: Terminal app; Windows: PowerShell or Git Bash; Linux: your shell).

2. Go to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd OrchestraACME
   ```

   *(Use the actual folder name where you cloned the repo.)*

3. Copy the settings template (first time only):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   This creates a configuration file. Defaults are fine for Level 0.

4. Start everything (**Path A — local Splunk**):

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile local up --build -d
   ```

   - The first run can take **5–15 minutes**.  
   - `-d` means “run in the background” so you can close the terminal window later.  
   - **PASS:** The command finishes without a red `ERROR` line.
   - **If `permission denied` on `docker.sock`:** See [PREREQUISITES.md](PREREQUISITES.md#fix-permission-denied-on-dockersock) — add your user to the `docker` group, then retry without `sudo`.

5. Check that services are running:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

   **PASS:** You see containers such as `acme_banking_app`, `acme_attack_panel`, `acme_ollama`, `acme_otel_collector`, and `acme_splunk`. Most show `healthy` or `running` after a few minutes.

6. **Wait for the AI model** (important — do not skip):

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f ollama
   ```

   Watch until you see a message that the model **`llama3.2:1b`** was pulled or is ready. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop watching logs.

   **PASS:** Ollama log shows the model is available.  
   **If stuck here:** Wait up to 10 minutes on a slow connection. Ask facilitator to run `docker compose logs ollama` and check disk space.

**Optional — see live startup logs for all services:**

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

Press **Ctrl+C** when bored — services keep running.

---

### Step 0.2 — Open the Attack Panel and check the lights

**Who does this:** Everyone.

1. Open your browser.

2. Go to: **http://localhost:5001**  
   *(Cloud VM: `http://<your-server-ip>:5001`)*

3. Look at the **top bar** of the page (dark header). You should see two status lines:

   | Status text | Meaning | PASS |
   |-------------|---------|------|
   | **TARGET ONLINE** (green) | Banking app is reachable | ✅ |
   | **LLM ONLINE** (green) | AI model is ready | ✅ |

4. If you see **TARGET OFFLINE** or **LLM OFFLINE** (red):

   - Wait 2–3 more minutes and refresh the page (F5).  
   - Confirm Step 0.1 finished and Ollama pulled the model.  
   - Run in terminal: `curl -s http://localhost:5000/health` — should return JSON with `"status": "healthy"`.

**PASS:** Both **TARGET ONLINE** and **LLM ONLINE** are green.

You should also see tabs such as **// Workshop** and **// Top 10 Scenarios**. Stay on **// Workshop** for later levels.

---

### Step 0.3 — Install the Splunk dashboard app

**Who does this:** Facilitator or anyone with Splunk admin on the lab instance.  
**What this does:** Adds the **GenAI Compliance Monitor** menus and dashboards inside Splunk.

#### Path A — Local Splunk in Docker

1. In terminal, from the `OrchestraACME` folder, build the install package (one time):

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/package_splunk_app.sh
   ./scripts/package_splunk_app.sh
   ```

   **PASS:** File exists: `dist/acme_genai_compliance-2.4.0.tar.gz` (version number may differ slightly).

2. Copy the app into Splunk and install it:

   ```bash
   docker cp dist/acme_genai_compliance-2.4.0.tar.gz acme_splunk:/tmp/
   docker compose exec splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk install app \
     /tmp/acme_genai_compliance-2.4.0.tar.gz -update 1 -auth admin:ACMEPassword2026!
   docker compose exec splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
   ```

   When prompted about the certificate or restart, accept defaults. Splunk restarts in **1–3 minutes**.

3. Open Splunk in your browser: **http://localhost:8000**

4. Log in:

   | Field | Default lab value |
   |-------|-------------------|
   | Username | `admin` |
   | Password | `ACMEPassword2026!` |

   *(Change this password in real deployments — see [CLOUD_VM_DEPLOYMENT.md](CLOUD_VM_DEPLOYMENT.md).)*

5. After login, open the app picker (top left). **PASS:** You see **GenAI Compliance Monitor** (or `acme_genai_compliance`).

6. Click **GenAI Compliance Monitor → Setup Guide** and skim the first page — it explains index and HEC in more detail.

**Full install reference:** [splunk_app/INSTALL.md](../splunk_app/INSTALL.md) Section 4.

#### Path B — Splunk Cloud or company Splunk

1. Ask your Splunk admin to install `dist/acme_genai_compliance-2.4.0.tar.gz` and create:

   - Index: `acme_agentic_telemetry`  
   - HEC token with sourcetype `otel:agentic:json`  

2. Admin puts the HEC URL and token into your lab machine’s `.env` file (`SPLUNK_HEC_ENDPOINT`, `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN`).

3. Start lab with external Splunk (Step 0.1 command Path B).

4. Log in to **your Splunk Cloud URL** (not localhost:8000). **PASS:** **GenAI Compliance Monitor** app appears.

**Full install reference:** [splunk_app/INSTALL.md](../splunk_app/INSTALL.md) Section 2.

---

### Step 0.4 — Confirm logs can reach Splunk (HEC)

**What HEC means:** HTTP Event Collector — the pipe that sends security events from the lab into Splunk. You configure this once.

#### Path A — Local Splunk (default `.env`)

`docker compose up` starts Splunk but **does not** enable HEC or create the index automatically. Run the bootstrap script once:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/splunk_local_bootstrap.sh
./scripts/splunk_local_bootstrap.sh
```

**PASS:** Script prints `HEC returned HTTP 200`.

**Quick UI check (optional):**

1. In Splunk (http://localhost:8000), go to **Settings → Data inputs → HTTP Event Collector**.  
2. **PASS:** HEC is **enabled**, and token `orchestra-acme-otel` exists.

3. Open **GenAI Compliance Monitor → Setup Guide** inside Splunk (after Step 0.3).  
4. **PASS:** Index `acme_agentic_telemetry` and sourcetype `otel:agentic:json`.

If events never appear after Step 0.5, re-run the bootstrap script and verify `SPLUNK_HEC_TOKEN` in `.env` — see [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) “Splunk quick checklist”.

#### Path B — Splunk Cloud

Your admin confirms `.env` on the lab machine has the correct **Splunk Cloud HEC URL** (starts with `https://http-inputs-`) and token. **PASS:** Facilitator runs a test ingest or you complete Step 0.5 and see events in Splunk Cloud Search.

---

### Step 0.5 — Confirm harmless “normal” traffic (not an attack)

**Why:** The workshop compares **normal** loan traffic with **attack** traffic. The banking app now sends **continuous baseline traffic** automatically once Ollama is healthy (every 90–240 seconds). You can still submit manual requests on the UI, but you should see events in Splunk without clicking anything.

**Who does this:** Everyone.

**Option A — Automatic (default)**

1. After stack startup, wait **~2–3 minutes** (Ollama model pull + 45s simulator delay).
2. Check simulator status: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/traffic/status` — `"running": true`, `ticks_ok` increasing.
3. Open Splunk → **GenAI Compliance Monitor → Overview**
4. **PASS:** Event count grows over time; many rows have `testbed_mode=BASELINE_TRAFFIC`.

**Option B — Manual (optional extra)**

1. Open the banking app: **http://localhost:5000**
2. Type a normal message, for example:

   ```text
   I would like to apply for a small business loan. Annual revenue is $250,000.
   ```

3. Click **Run Through All Agents** / **Process**.
4. Wait **30–60 seconds** for logs to travel: Banking app → collector → Splunk.

**Splunk validation (everyone)**

1. Open Splunk → **GenAI Compliance Monitor → Overview**

2. **PASS (non-technical):** A number greater than **0** appears for total events. Charts may show agent names.

3. **PASS (technical optional):** In **Search**, run:

   ```spl
   `acme_genai_index` earliest=-15m
   | stats count by testbed_mode gen_ai.agent.name
   ```

   You should see `BASELINE_TRAFFIC` and/or `BANKING_LIVE` counts across agents such as `acme-agent-intake-001`.

4. **Filter attacks only** (exclude baseline noise):

   ```spl
   `acme_genai_index` earliest=-1h NOT testbed_mode=BASELINE_TRAFFIC
   ```

If Overview shows **0** events, wait another 60 seconds and click refresh. Still zero → see troubleshooting below.

---

### Level 0 complete — final checklist

Check every box before moving to [Level 1](#level-1--pipeline-proof-everyone):

- [ ] `docker compose ps` shows main containers running  
- [ ] http://localhost:5001 → **TARGET ONLINE** and **LLM ONLINE**  
- [ ] http://localhost:8000 → Splunk login works (Path A) *or* Splunk Cloud login works (Path B)  
- [ ] **GenAI Compliance Monitor** app visible in Splunk  
- [ ] **Overview** dashboard shows event count **> 0** after the benign loan (Step 0.5)  
- [ ] You know which URL to use for Attack Panel and Splunk for the rest of the workshop  

**Congratulations — Level 0 is complete.**  
Next: [Level 1 — Pipeline proof](#level-1--pipeline-proof-everyone) (**▶ RUN FIRST WIN PATH** on the Attack Panel).

---

### Level 0 troubleshooting (plain language)

| What you see | Likely cause | What to try |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| `docker compose` command not found | Docker not installed or not running | Start **Docker Desktop**; reopen terminal |
| Attack Panel **LLM OFFLINE** | Model still downloading | `docker compose logs -f ollama` — wait for `llama3.2:1b` |
| Attack Panel **TARGET OFFLINE** | Banking container not up | `docker compose ps` — restart: `docker compose --profile local up -d` |
| Splunk login page won’t load | Splunk still starting (up to 8 min) | `docker compose logs -f splunk` — wait for “running” |
| Splunk **Overview** shows 0 events | HEC not configured or too soon | Run `./scripts/splunk_local_bootstrap.sh`; wait 60s after Step 0.5 |
| OTel logs `connection reset by peer` on 8088 | HEC disabled or index missing | `./scripts/splunk_local_bootstrap.sh` |
| OTel logs `permission denied` on `otel-raw-genai.jsonl` | Shared volume permissions | Bootstrap script fixes this; `docker compose restart otel_collector` |
| Bootstrap `Permission denied` on `/opt/splunk/...` | Old bootstrap used Splunk CLI as root | `git pull` and re-run `./scripts/splunk_local_bootstrap.sh` |

**Still stuck?** Collect for your facilitator: output of `docker compose ps`, screenshot of Attack Panel header, and screenshot of Splunk Overview.

---

### Facilitator notes for Level 0

- Run Step 0.5 **once per room** on a shared screen so everyone sees Overview go from 0 → non-zero.  
- For mixed audiences: non-technical learners only need Steps **0.2**, **0.5**, and Splunk **Overview**; tech lead does **0.1**, **0.3**, **0.4**.  
- Budget **15 minutes** after `docker compose up` before declaring failure — Splunk and Ollama are slow on first boot.  
- Default Splunk password is for **lab only** — rotate on any internet-facing VM.

## Level 1 — Pipeline proof (everyone)

**Goal:** See three different control philosophies in one sitting.

**Attack Panel:** **▶ RUN FIRST WIN PATH** (Scenarios 6 → 5 → 9)

| Scenario | Surface | What you teach |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| 6 | MCP tools | Block **before** LLM (`workflow.block_reason`) |
| 5 | Output gateway | Block or flag **after** LLM (`defenseclaw.action`) |
| 9 | RAG | **Detect-only** — alert without always blocking |

**Splunk dashboards:** Overview · Detection Efficacy · Control Attestation

**Level 1 check — answer in Splunk Search:**

<details>
<summary><strong>Q101</strong> — Which scenario produced a workflow block before the model ran?</summary>

```spl
`acme_genai_index` earliest=-30m campaign_week=6
| stats count by workflow.block_reason workflow.blocked
```

Look for `workflow.blocked=true` and a tool-scope `workflow.block_reason` on Scenario 6 events.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q102</strong> — Which field tells you DefenseClaw acted on output?</summary>

```spl
`acme_genai_index` earliest=-30m campaign_week=5
| table defenseclaw.action defenseclaw_blocked codeguard_blocked workflow.blocked
```

**Answer field:** `defenseclaw.action` (e.g. `HARD_DENY`, `ALLOW`).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q103</strong> — Scenario 9: was the attack blocked or only observed?</summary>

```spl
`acme_campaign_w9` earliest=-30m
| table workflow.blocked galileo_observe_alert vector_retrieval_count control.status
```

Discuss why detect-only may be correct for retrieval exfiltration.

</details>

---

## Level 2 — SOC hunts (junior → senior analyst)

**Goal:** Field discovery and hunt writing — same pedagogy as [Splunk BOTS](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3) 200-series, but on agentic telemetry.

**Prerequisite:** Level 1 complete.

**Attack Panel:** **▶ RUN FIRST WIN PATH** again if events aged out, then fire **Scenario 8** manually (Top 10 tab).

### Hunt progression (do in order)

## Splunk vs Jupyter — recommendation

### Stay Splunk-native (recommended)

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Audience expectation** | Analysts and detection engineers live in Splunk Search and ES — not notebooks |
| **Already built in** | Threat Hunting, MLTK Anomaly Hunting, and playbook lookups ship hunt SPL in the app |
| **One less dependency** | No Python kernel, `splunk-sdk`, or notebook server to debug in class |
| **BOTS precedent** | [Splunk BOTS](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3) teaches via **questions + SPL in Splunk** — this curriculum follows that pattern (Q201–Q503 above) |

This guide **is** your notebook: ordered questions, collapsible SPL, Attack Panel buttons for reproducible data generation.

### When Jupyter might make sense (optional, not default)

Consider a **separate optional appendix** only if:

- Audience is **ML/data science** leaning and already lives in Jupyter
- You run a **multi-day** course with homework outside Splunk
- You want `splunk-sdk` programmatic exports for research (Dataset Export dashboard already covers HF export)

**Risk of Jupyter as primary UI:** splits attention, feels like “extra tooling,” and duplicates what Splunk Search already does. For Splunk/Cisco workshops, it often **pulls people away** from the SIEM they need to operate in production.

### If you add Jupyter later (lightweight pattern)

Do **not** replace Splunk. Use Jupyter as a **facilitator-only** or **homework** artifact:

```text
Cell 1: Markdown — Q204 question text (copy from this doc)
Cell 2: splunk-sdk query — same SPL as Search
Cell 3: Markdown — discussion / expected fields
```

Keep Attack Panel for attacks; keep Splunk as the student-facing hunt surface.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Zero events in Q201 | Complete Level 0; run First Win; check HEC token and index |
| Q210 empty | Run Standard Workshop (KC-C001) |
| Q401 all NOT_OBSERVED | Run Deep Workshop; widen time range to 24h |
| MAESTRO step cancelled | Install CSA MAESTRO on :9002 — [MAESTRO_WORKSHOP.md](MAESTRO_WORKSHOP.md) |
| Cisco preflight skipped | Start `docker-compose.cisco.yml` overlay |
