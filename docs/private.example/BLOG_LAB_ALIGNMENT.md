# Blog ↔ Lab Alignment (10-Week Campaign) — INTERNAL

**Not for public workshop or customer materials.** Copy to `docs/private/BLOG_LAB_ALIGNMENT.md` on your machine.

Maps OrchestraACME Workshop scenarios to blog narrative tracks in `apps/framework/campaign_manifest.py`. Use when writing Splunk/Cisco blog posts or internal teaching from the lab.

| W1 | 1 — Code Compliance Illusion | Prompt drift vs code audits | AIBOM → Splunk lookup / drift hunt | [cisco-ai-defense/aibom](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/aibom) |
| W2 | 2 — Evaluation Harness | Structured eval roles | Foundry trace SPL | OTel `foundry.*` fields |
| W3 | 3 — Vibe Coding | IDE guardrails | CodeGuard input validation SPL | Lab CodeGuard + Cisco field names |
| W4 | 4 — Shadow SLM | Rogue edge models | SLM asset discovery dashboard | `slm.unapproved` telemetry |

| W9 | 9 — Invisible Leak | RAG exfiltration | Behavioral anomaly hunts | Galileo-style `galileo_*` fields |
| W10 | 10 — Self-Healing SOC | Memory + rogue agent | SOAR 2s containment playbook | SOAR sim + Splunk ES |

## Workshop paths that cover blog demos

| Workshop path | Blog weeks best demonstrated |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| 15-Minute First Win | W5, W6, W9 |
| Standard Workshop | + kill chain (multi-stage narrative) |
| Deep Workshop | Full MITRE coverage matrix |
| Fire All 10 | All blog tracks (telemetry only) |
| **Cisco + MLTK Anomaly Hunt** | W1, W6, W7, W9 + Foundation-Sec-8B |

## Splunk dashboards per blog track 2

| Blog demo theme | Dashboard |
|-----------------|-----------|
| AIBOM / drift | Control Attestation, MLTK Anomaly Hunting |
| DefenseClaw / output gateway | Control Attestation, Overview |
| MCP abuse | Detection Efficacy, MLTK Anomaly Hunting |
| CTSM token surge | **MLTK Anomaly Hunting** |
| RAG behavioral | Threat Hunting, MLTK Anomaly Hunting |
| Kill-chain / SOAR | Actor Chain Story, Kill-Chain Timeline |

## Foundation-Sec-8B in blogs

Position as **hunt copilot** (not autonomous blocker): analysts paste hunt rows into `POST /api/v1/hunt/foundation-sec` for MITRE-aligned triage bullets. Model card: [fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B](https://huggingface.co/fdtn-ai/Foundation-Sec-8B).
